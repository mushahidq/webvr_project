## Inspiration

We thought about ways we could help the environment as individuals. This is more important than ever, especially since some people may not be able to work together during the pandemic. We decided that learning to grow a plant virtually would give beginners the education necessary to take the first steps in helping the environment around them.

## What it does

It shows users how to grow a plant and contains tips on how to give your plant the best chance at surviving.

## How we built it

We used WebVR for the application and 3D models were downloaded from the internet

## Challenges we ran into

This was my first time working with AR/VR so I didn't know how to get started
Also Unity kept crashing and the builds to Android were not working so I decided to go with WebVR

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We learnt a lot about AR/VR in unity and on the web.
We also learned how to work with 3D models

## What we learned

WebVR, ARFoundation, ARCore, AR.js

## What's next for SugarContent VR

We will try to add some user interaction and maybe we'll port to unity and try AR
