# webvr_project

## Inspiration

This idea from the ideabank seemed like something that being a newbie to VR/AR I would be able to build on my own. I joined the hackathon pretty late so unfortunately I was not able to complete it.

## What it does

It shows some 3d models with the amount of sugar in them

## How I built it

I used WebVR for the application and 3D models were downloaded from the internet

## Challenges we ran into

This was my first time working with AR/VR so I didn't know how to get started
Also Unity kept crashing and the builds to Android were not working so I decided to go with WebVR

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I learnt a lot about AR/VR in unity and on the web

## What we learned

WebVR, ARFoundation, ARCore, AR.js

## What's next for SugarContent VR

Some user interaction and maybe I'll port to unity and try AR
